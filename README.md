##Music Generation app for android using ionic and a new Cordova plugin that bundles a copy of the Supercollider engine and provides a javascript interface for sending the supercollider server messages and loading synths.


### Build Instructions:
 1. Install Node.js if not present to use npm
 2. Install ionic globally:
    npm install -G ionic
 3. If you are on a Unix based system or using cygwin, you can build and deploy to the default connected android device by running
    ./run.sh
    from the project root directory.
 4. Otherwise, manually run the ionic commands in the run.sh script
